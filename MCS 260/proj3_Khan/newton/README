Program Description:


Program to import poly.py to use functions to get poly_prime() and eval_poly(),
newton() to find roots of the polynomial. Continue from w8L1 and where each created functions to evaluate polynomials 
and find the derivative of a polynomial. Make a function to use newtons method to 
find the roots and define functions or evaluating polynomials and finding the 
derivative of a polynomial these are needed for newtons method for finding 
roots of polynomials.

It will Do:
1. input polynomial
2. prompt for: x0, tol, MAX_ITR
3. call newton to find roots (if exists)
4. user can repeat with same polynomial but different  x0, tol and 
MAX_ITR.
5. newton() tests for divide-by-zero, method not converging.
 
To use:
	front user needs to type in the terminal python main.py and then type in the 
	values.
