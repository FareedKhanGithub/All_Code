Program Description:

The assignment had a typo that said to put a "S" in Sweatshirt. I wanted to change
the S to s but this may put risk on losing the git commits related to the file.


	The program works by the Frontuser inputing the information
of the amount of shirts in each catagory of size and then in
each catagory of College. Starting from College 1 and ending in College 7.
All of these data inputs are then stored in a 2 dimensional list which is 
displayed in the screen (terminal).


	The program test1.txt is just an aid for testing so the frontuser 
doesnt need to keep on typing numbers repeatedly for small adjustments. 
Inorder to adjust test1.txt you need to change the first number in each row. 
Once done then right beside theprogram insert "<" and type the test1.py program 
then run.
