Program Description:

These are the results of all possible scenarios that can occur in the program.
# all complex numbers are roots
# no real or complex roots
# one root:
# perfect square => double root
# two real roots
# two complex roots


 
This program reads the text file (quadabc.txt) and uses the numbers in the 
text file and then outputs the answers to the quadratic formula.
Inorder to use the program you need to put three numbers in the 
infile(quadabc.txt) then go to the terminal and put python main.py and press enter.
The results will be written to the outfile (quadroots.txt).
