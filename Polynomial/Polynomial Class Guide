Polynomial class guide

To create a class of polynomial classify as such:
Polynomial x(vector<int> of some kind)

To call on methods of the Polynomial class use Polynomial.

Ex; Polynomial.(functions will appear here)

List of functions:

-add(will require another Polynomial class as a parameter)
-subtract(will require another Polynomial class as a parameter)
-scalar(will require an int value)
-evaluate(will require a double value)
-get_coefficients()
-degree()
-newV(will require another vector<int>)
-resize(will require an int value)

Explanation of functions:

add- will add two different polynomials together and output the result
subtract- will subtract two different polynomials together and output the result
scalar- will multiply the coefficients of the polynomial by a scalar value inputed by the user
evaluate- will evaluate the polynomial at a certain value inputed by the user
get_coefficients-will return the coefficients of the polynomial
degree- will return the degree of the polynomial
newV- will reassign the base vector of the class to its original value
resize-will resize the base vector of the class to an int value inputed by the user
