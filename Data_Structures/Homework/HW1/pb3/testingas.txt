The World Wide Web's extraordinary reach is based in part on its open assimilation 
of document formats. Although Web transfer protocols and addressing can accommodate
 any kinds of resources, the unique application context of a truly global 
hypermedia system favours the adoption of certain Web-adapted formats. 
In this paper we consider the evolutionary record that has led to the ascent of 
the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). We present a taxonomy of document species 
in the Web according to their sy:wntax, style, structure, and semantics. We observe 
the preferential adoption of SGML, CSS, HTML, and XML, respectively, which 
leverage a parsimonious evolutionary strategy favouring declarative encodings 
over Turing-complete languages; separable styles over inline formatting; 
declarative markup over presentational markup; and well-defined semantics over 
operational behavior. The paper concludes with an evolutionary walkthrough of 
citation formats. Ultimately, combined with the self-referential power of the Web 
to document itself, we believe XML can 
catalyze a critical shift of the Web from a global information space into a 
universal knowledge network.
