B) The most optimal method for implementing the Ackerman Function would be the recursive method. 
Because Non-Recursive a linear loop in which the code ends when loop condition no longer applies.
Recursive is easier to implement and apply in continous changing enviroment amongst multiple variables 
that can iterate downwards or upwards in same structure until the conditions no longer apply and 
then go through the if statement.
