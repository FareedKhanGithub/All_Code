1)how to set variables.

before the program is run, the user the will need insert the numbers into input1
where interger has its own line. User will then run the cpp file. User 
will be prompted to set the m(chunk sizes).


2) THe general algorithm.

Reads input file, m numbers at a time. Sorts locally within the size m, writes to 
output1 and output2 files. Sorts based of chunk number m and writes them back into 
input1 and input2.
Merges input1 and input2 and sorts based off the full chunks then that is written
to output1. Numbers that are not part of full chunks are sorted and
written into output2.Output1 and output2 are merged and sorted,
thus creates sorted.txt



3) What is the purpose of the program?

The purpose of the project is do a 2 way merge sort which allows the frontuser to 
adjust the size of m and use a list of numbers from a text file.
