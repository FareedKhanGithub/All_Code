      I would say the Project 1 was a 7 in difficulty. The reason why might this be is
because I did not take langauge and automata class before taking this class, so the 
information was very new to me.

     At first I felt there was quite a learning curve to the project because it is very
different from the usaul coding assignments I have done in past.It really help to 
compare by typing the individual symbols into the text files and then "make".
This allowed me to give exact scenario to pinpoint exactly of what the 
response was in the file.

     In this project I learned regular expressions and how a compiler scanner 
works. The scanner uses the numbers as storage locations and creates tokens this happens 
in the cmparser.tab.h file. Also regular expressions are made which 
we give titles to represent them, then these names then link to the 
tokens. Then once using the scanner the regular expressions and tokens will be
 flags for error or non-error or keywords the user has typed down.

     One of the difficulties that I had was knowing when to use and not use the +  
symbol for the regular expressions. With using the | symbol it was alot easier to 
list the forbidden words and not have each individual letter char come up as a error
token.
